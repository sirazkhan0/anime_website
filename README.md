the latest technologies in web development! We used React.js, a popular front-end library, and the Jikan API to create a fast, responsive, and comprehensive platform for anime fans worldwide.

Our website allows you to browse through a vast collection of anime titles, from the most popular to the newest releases. You can search for titles by name, genre, rating, or even by the voice actors who brought them to life. Each title page includes detailed information, such as its synopsis, episode list, and related characters.
